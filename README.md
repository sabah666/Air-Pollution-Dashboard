# Air-Pollution-Dashboard

The aim of this project is an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard is made on javascript, HTML and CSS. 
The dashboard visualizes mortality due to air pollution and compares it against the total population of the selected country.

There are 5 different types of visualization in the dashboard:
1. Choropleth map, 
2. Pie chart, 
3. Clustered bar chart,
4. Bar chart 
5. Line chart.

The dashboard is deployed on live server and has no downtime.
We have also added dark mode to the dashboard to make it more user friendly.
